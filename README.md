# MusicalArchive
This is an archive-type site that I created to help keep track of my physical record/cassette/CD collection. It was created with Craft CMS and the majority of custom code in this project is front-end based.

If you wish to see examples of back-end code that I have written, please see some of my other repositories, such as [Authwave for Python](https://github.com/Authwave/python-client).
